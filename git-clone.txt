When you use git clone the following happens:
1. It creates a directory under the cloned file name in your current directory
mkdir clonefile name
2. It moves into the directory
cd clonefile
3. It sets up git (dropping the .git file)
git init
4. It adds a remote to github, to allow pushes and pulls between the origin
git remote add origin URL
5. Pulls anything from the repo 
git pull
6. Goes back to the parent folder
cd ..
